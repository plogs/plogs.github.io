# About SeattleBars.org and "Project K-Bar"

What is <a href='http://www.seattlebars.org/'>Project K-Bar</a>?

For some reason in early 2006 I got the idea that I should try to
document as many different bars as I could where I have had a drink,
and to continue to document new bars until I could identify 1,000
that I had visited (hence the "K" in "Project K-Bar"). I came up with
a list of 466 bars that I clearly remembered stopping in, and started
counting new ones from there. Once I'd reached 1,000, and had a
better idea of how many bars there were in Seattle, as well as how
many opened and closed each year, it seemed within reach to have a
drink at every bar in Seattle.
