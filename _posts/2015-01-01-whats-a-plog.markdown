A _plog_, in simple terms, is a place link ([plnkx](https://www.plnkx.com)) that points to
a blog that has information relevant to a specific location. Often
the blog points back to the place link.

This creates a symbiotic relationship, wherein both information
providers reinforce and support one another.

However, this definition is informal. Any internet site that contains
location-specific information is a likely candidate for plogging.
