# plnkx-ified

_plnkx_-_ified_? As my English teacher used to
say, "You can verb-ify anything!"

Below are imagined location-specific comments that might have been
posted if [plnkx](https://www.plnkx.com) existed
back then.

# 8th grade class, 1901

What did the class of 1901 look like? And what did they think?
We'll never know what they thought. But it might have been this...

Concord School is the third public elementary school for South Park
since 1892. Once a community of Italian and Japanese farmers, South
Park is hemmed in by freeways and industry, but Concord School still
educates the community's children.

South Park was first settled by farmers in the 1850s. It was platted
as a town in 1889, but development was slow. In 1892, Brothers School
was opened by two Belgian friars on College Hill. South Park became
its own city in 1905 and joined Seattle in 1907.

In 1907, South Park School was built on 12th Avenue S between S
Sullivan Street and S Thistle Street. In January 1914, the Seattle
School District completed Concord School and students and teachers
trooped from the old school to the new one.

Concord School is designed in the Colonial Revival style and built
out of brick. It was remodeled and a wing was added in 2000.
